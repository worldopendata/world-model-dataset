## Overview

WorldModel Data Atlas helps researchers answer a practical question:

> Which dataset should I use to train or evaluate the world-model capability I care about?

Unlike chronological paper lists, this catalog organizes datasets by the world-model capability they primarily support. Domain, modality, structure, source, access, and licensing metadata provide additional context without duplicating datasets across sections.

The GitHub README is the browsable community catalog. The [interactive website](https://worldopendata.github.io/world-model-dataset/) adds search, filtering, bilingual display, and detailed comparisons.

## Why this catalog

- **Task-first organization** — start from the capability you want to train or evaluate
- **Research-oriented metadata** — compare modalities, scale, structure, source, access, and licensing
- **Bilingual content** — use the English or Chinese README and switch languages on the website
- **Curated resource links** — follow official homepages, papers, and code repositories
- **Evidence-aware notes** — understand both useful properties and important limitations
- **Reproducible maintenance** — generate the website and both README catalogs from one data source

This is a curated research resource, not a ranking. Detailed suitability notes on the website are more informative than a single aggregate score.

## Taxonomy

Each dataset has exactly one primary task. Secondary uses and cross-cutting properties are represented as tags.

| Dimension | Question it answers | Examples |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Primary task** | What capability does it mainly train or evaluate? | Prediction, action-conditioned dynamics, decision-making |
| **Domain** | In what kind of world was it collected? | Robotics, driving, games, physics |
| **Modality** | What signals are available? | Video, action, robot state, LiDAR, language |
| **Structure** | How are samples organized? | Temporal sequences, trajectories, interaction episodes |
| **Source** | How was the data produced? | Real-world, simulation, teleoperation, synthetic |

The six primary tasks are:

1. **Predictive & Generative Dynamics** — future observation or state prediction, video prediction, and long-horizon generation
2. **Action-Conditioned Dynamics** — learning how the world changes in response to an action
3. **Decision-Making & Agent Trajectories** — planning, control, imitation learning, offline RL, and agent behavior
4. **Spatial & Spatiotemporal World Modeling** — 3D/4D reconstruction, occupancy, scene flow, and dynamic spatial representations
5. **Physical & Causal Reasoning** — physical properties, interactions, interventions, and counterfactual reasoning
6. **World Model Evaluation & Diagnostics** — datasets primarily designed to measure model capabilities and failure modes

If only one use could be retained, the dataset's most distinctive world-model use becomes its primary task.

## Dataset catalog

Entries are grouped by primary task and sorted by year within each group. The README shows discovery-oriented metadata; the website provides scale, organizations, license notes, secondary tasks, data structure, source, and editorial guidance.

## Contributing and corrections

Please use GitHub Issues for all contributions and corrections. You can suggest a new dataset, report inaccurate metadata or broken links, question a classification, or share an update from an official source. When opening an issue, include the relevant official links, access and license information, primary task, and English and Chinese descriptions when available.

The project was inspired by community-maintained world-model resources, especially [Awesome World Models](https://github.com/knightnemo/Awesome-World-Models), while focusing specifically on dataset discovery, comparison, and selection.
